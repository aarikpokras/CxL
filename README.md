C++ Extended Language

CxL is currently under (a lot of) development and isn't exactly very viable right now. Please bear with me.

CxL adds on to the existing features of C++, making it more beginner-friendly and making compiled languages less daunting. It focuses on being compact, fast, and straightforward. It aims to be the "go-to" language that people use when they want to write a program.
